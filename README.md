# Business-Card-OCR

To run the Business Card Reader, take the three Java files: main, BusinessCardParser, and ContactInfo and put them all into one package. Then, run the main.java file. The program will then output the name, phone, and email from the business card to the console. To change the the business card to a different business card, goto the main.java file and set the doc variable to the new business card.
